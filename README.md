# medication-efficacy-estimator

This personal project is based off skills I learned in UBC's Computer Science 210 (Software Construction), such as effective organization, 
the importance of refactoring, and more! I was inspired my interest in the combination of healthcare and computer science, which I hope to 
continue learning more about.
